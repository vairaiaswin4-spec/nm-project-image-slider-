3.How It Works

Image Setup: Multiple images are added to the slider section in the HTML file.

Styling and Animation: CSS is used to style the slider container, set dimensions, and define transition effects (like fade, slide, or zoom).

Automatic and Manual Control: JavaScript automatically changes images after a fixed time interval using timers, and users can also manually navigate using next/previous buttons or indicators.

Responsive Design: The layout automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on mobile and desktop devices.

Deployment: The final project is hosted online (e.g., GitHub Pages or Netlify) for easy access and sharing.
